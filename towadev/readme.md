This is a full tower defense game i wrote, which uses advanced HTML5 and Javascript techniques, like async script loading, modules resolving, etc.

It works on all modern browser and runs on mobile/tablet devices too ;-)

But it requires a webserver due to the dynamic script and resource loading.

The main game does not require any dependencies, everything is written myself.

For the editor.html and calc.html though "Bootstrap UI" and "jQuery" is required!
